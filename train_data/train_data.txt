986	The therapeutic_activity of cefozopran , a new_semisynthetic_parenteral_cephalosporin , was compared with those of ceftazidime , ampicillin , imipenem/cilastatin and ofloxacin against an ascending mixed_urinary_tract DIS00infection induced in mice with BAC00Enterococcus_faecalis TN2005 and BAC00Pseudomonas_aeruginosa P9 .

988	It has recently been discovered that BAC00Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , an oral_bacterium causing DIS00periodontitis , produces cytolethal_distending toxin , a cell cycle-modulating toxin that has three protein subunits : CdtA , CdtB , and CdtC .

989	Llamas were experimentally infected with BAC00Mycobacterium_bovis in order to evaluate the axillary_skin test and the ELISA as diagnostic_procedures for DIS00tuberculosis in llamas .	DIS00tuberculosis&BAC00Mycobacterium_bovis&diagnostic_procedure
990	A highly potent_anti-MRSA_sesquiterpenoid has been isolated from Ulmus davidiana BAC00var0_japonica , which has been traditionally used to treat DIS00infectious_diseases in Korea .	DIS00infectious_diseases&BAC00var0_japonica&treat
991	Forty juvenile_full_siblings from each of 120 families were infected with the BAC00bacterium_Aeromonas_salmonicida , which causes high_mortality in salmon due to DIS00furunculosis .	DIS00furunculosis&BAC00bacterium_Aeromonas_salmonicida&cause

995	With respect to the 16S rRNA gene , the groESL gene , and the ank gene , the DNA sequences of the two BAC00equine_Ehrlichia_isolates were identical to sequences found in isolates from clinical_cases of DIS00granulocytic_ehrlichiosis in humans and domestic_animals in Sweden .	None
996	With the aim of studying whether a general_vaccination against invasive_disease caused by BAC00Haemophilus_influenzae_type b is economically profitable_bearing in mind the efficacy and safety of the vaccine , its price and the global_cost that this disease has in our area , a review is conducted of patients admitted due to DIS00invasive_disease caused by Hib in the Children 's Hospital La Fe , Valencia , born between 1984 and 1993 .
